# 📝 KhaoNiew

This project aims to provide a user-friendly web and mobile app for nutritional monitoring in rural areas. Users can log their meals, and the app will analyze their nutrient intake, showing how much more they can eat that day. Healthcare providers can monitor patients' diets, set dietary limits, and receive alerts when a user exceeds nutrient recommendations.
